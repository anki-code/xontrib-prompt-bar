The bar theme for [xonsh shell](https://xon.sh).

## Install
```
xpip install -U git+https://github.com/anki-code/xontrib-theme-bar
echo 'xontrib load theme_bar' >> ~/.xonshrc
# Reload xonsh
```

## Help wanted
It will be great if it will be reimplemented as shows in awesome [example from Jonathan Slenders](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/examples/prompts/fancy-zsh-prompt.py).
